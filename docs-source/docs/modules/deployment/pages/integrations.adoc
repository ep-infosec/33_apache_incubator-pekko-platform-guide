Stateful services need a datastore. You can store state using xref:concepts:event-sourcing.adoc[Event Sourcing] or CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The example in the tutorial demonstrates the Event Sourcing option. The tutorial uses PostgreSQL for xref:microservices-tutorial:entity.adoc[storing the events] and xref:microservices-tutorial:entity.adoc[creating a Projection for queries]. An alternative to using an RDBMS is described in xref:how-to:cassandra-alternative.adoc[]. For more details on migrating your model from CRUD to Event Sourcing review xref:how-to:from-crud-to-eventsourcing.adoc[].

To decouple communication between different Microservices, you can publish messages to a broker, such as Apache Kafka. The tutorial illustrates how to use Apache Kafka in xref:microservices-tutorial:projection-kafka.adoc[a projection publishing to Kafka]. See xref:concepts:internal-and-external-communication.adoc[Internal and External Communication concepts] for more information.
