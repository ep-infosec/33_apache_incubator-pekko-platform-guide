include::partial$include.adoc[]

This page describes the general workflow for deploying an application. Each step of the xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] also has instructions of how to run in Kubernetes. The tutorial includes build files for creating Docker images and template deployment descriptors.

The steps below assume that you have already read the xref:deployment:index.adoc[overview of Kubernetes deployment], and have created a Kubernetes cluster and installed the Akka Operator (in xref:deployment:aws-install.adoc[AWS] or xref:deployment:gcp-install.adoc[GCP]).

== Build Docker image

Build and publish a Docker image of the application.

[.tabset]
AWS::
+
Follow the instructions in xref:deployment:aws-ecr.adoc[Amazon Elastic Container Registry] to deploy Docker images on AWS's container registry.

GCP::
+
Follow the instructions in https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/using-with-google-cloud-platform[Using Container Registry with Google Cloud {tab-icon}, window="tab"] to deploy Docker images on GCP's container registry.

== Update the deployment descriptor

Update the deployment descriptor in `kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml` of the `AkkaMicroservice` that the Akka Operator will use when deploying the application in Kubernetes.

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml:
[source,yaml]
----
include::microservices-tutorial:example$01-shopping-cart-service-scala/kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml[]
----

<1> Replace `<docker-registry>` with your docker registry address and update the image reference with the image tag you just created. The specific value and syntax of the `<docker-registry>` can vary depending on the registry you used. the most popular registries include https://hub.docker.com/[DockerHub {tab-icon}, window="tab] and https://quay.io/[Quay.io {tab-icon}, window="tab] but you are probably publishing your images to AWS's xref:aws-ecr.adoc[ECR] or the Container Registry in GCP. +
 +
If you published to AWS's ECR, the final value of the `image:` property will look similar to: `803424716218.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/shopping-cart-service:20201209-135004-363ae2b`. +
 +
If you are using the container registry in GCP, the `image:` property will be similar to `eu.gcr.io/earthly-project-41643/shopping-cart-service:20201209-135004-363ae2b`.


== Apply to Kubernetes

Deploy the `shopping-cart-service-cr.yml` to Kubernetes:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
----

It will also create the namespace `shopping`

It can be convenient to set that namespace as current instead of specifying the `--namespace` parameter in all `kubectl` commands.

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=shopping
----

The Akka Operator will notice the deployment descriptor and deploy the `shopping-cart-service`. You can see progress by viewing the status:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get akkamicroservices
----

See xref:deployment:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting deployment status] for more details.

You can list the pods with:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get pods
----

Inspect logs:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl logs -f <shopping-cart-service pod name from above>
----

== Repeat

If you change the application, repeat the above steps. Kubernetes will perform a rolling update of the application.

== Delete

You can terminate all Pods of the application by deleting the deployment descriptor:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl delete akkamicroservices/shopping-cart-service --namespace=shopping
----
