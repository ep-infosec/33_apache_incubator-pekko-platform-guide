= Custom Kubernetes Deployment

include::partial$include.adoc[]

Users with a
{lightbend-developer-docs}/introduction/getting-started/subscription-and-credentials.html[Lightbend Subscription {tab-icon}, window="tab"] have access to the Akka Cloud Platform operator to run on their own Kubernetes cluster.

In order to best understand the basic deployment architecture and workflow, make sure you read the xref:cloud-deployment.adoc[] and xref:deploy.adoc[] before proceeding further.

== Prepare your cluster

NOTE: Running the Akka Cloud Platform operator requires Kubernetes 1.19 or newer.

Verify that your `kubectl` context points to your local Kubernetes cluster (for example, {minikube}[minikube {tab-icon}, window="tab"]), or an external Kubernetes cluster (as illustrated in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough[Azure {tab-icon}, window="tab"]).

Next, make sure you have the akka-operator-helm chart:

[source,shell script]
----
helm repo add akka-operator-helm https://lightbend.github.io/akka-operator-helm/
helm repo update
----

Create environment variables with your {lightbend-com-account}/lightbend-platform/loginCredentials[Lightbend Login Credentials {tab-icon}, window="tab"]:


[source,shell script]
----
export LIGHTBEND_COMMERCIAL_USERNAME=12345678-aaa-bbb-cccc-ddddeeeeff0e@lightbend
export LIGHTBEND_COMMERCIAL_PASSWORD=abcdef1243568790ababab470556835429873569
----

Install the operator with the command:

[source,shell script,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm upgrade -i akka-operator akka-operator-helm/akka-operator \
  --set lightbendSubscription.username=$LIGHTBEND_COMMERCIAL_USERNAME \
  --set lightbendSubscription.password=$LIGHTBEND_COMMERCIAL_PASSWORD \
  --namespace lightbend \
  --version={akka-cloud-platform-version}  # <1>
----
<1> `{akka-cloud-platform-version}` is the latest available version.

The cluster is now ready for you to xref:deploy.adoc[deploy] `AkkaMicroservice` services.

== Known limitations

Deploying the Akka Cloud Platform operator xref:gcp-install.adoc[with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)] or xref:aws-index.adoc[with Amazon Web Services (AWS)] enables integration with databases, message brokers, and ingress specific to GCP or AWS.

When you install the Akka Cloud Platform operator on a custom Kubernetes cluster, it will not be in charge of creating the `Ingress` instances required to handle external traffic into your `AkkaMicroservice`. This is unlike the deployment on xref:aws-ingress.adoc[AWS] or xref:gcp-ingress.adoc[GCP], where the operator can fine-tune all the necessary resources. The `Ingress` resources require cloud-specific tuning. You will need to refer to your Kubernetes provider (such as minikube docs, Azure docs) to create an Ingress that can handle TLS-enabled, HTTP/2 traffic to serve gRPC externally.

As a consequence, when deploying on custom-managed Kubernetes clusters you can't use the `grpcIngress` and `httpIngress` properties of the `AkkaMicroservice` Spec:

.kubernetes/shopping-cart-service-cr.yml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: akka.lightbend.com/v1
kind: AkkaMicroservice
metadata:
  name: shopping-cart-service
spec:
  image: <image>
  replicas: 3
  httpPort: "8080"
  grpcPort: "8101"
#  grpcIngress:
#    enabled: true
#    certificate: ingress-secret
#    class: ???
#  httpIngress:
#    enabled: true
#    certificate: ingress-secret
#    class: ???
