=== Connect to the Grafana UI

NOTE: The following commands will help you to access the Grafana UI, but they do not expose the Grafana service to the internet.

First you need to get the user and password that you use to login to the Grafana UI:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-user}" | base64 --decode ; echo
kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo
----

After that, you need to start a port forwarder to expose the Grafana UI service:

[source,shell script]
----
kubectl port-forward --namespace default service/grafana 3000:80
----

You can then open your browser and access the Grafana UI at <http://localhost:3000>. Log in with the user and password that you got above. If you navigate to <http://localhost:3000/datasources> you will see the "Cinnamon Prometheus" data source that was created automatically when running `pulumi up`. If you navigate to <http://localhost:3000/dashboards> you will see the https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/telemetry/current/visualizations/grafana.html[Grafana dashboards from Lightbend Telemetry] were also installed.
