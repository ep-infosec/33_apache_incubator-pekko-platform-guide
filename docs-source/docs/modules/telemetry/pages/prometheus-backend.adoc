= Using Prometheus as the metrics backend
:page-toclevels: 3

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Lightbend Telemetry can report metrics to https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus {tab-icon}, window="tab"] using a backend plugin integrated with the https://github.com/prometheus/client_java[Prometheus JVM client {tab-icon}, window="tab"].

The following is the core Cinnamon Prometheus dependency that you will need to add to your build tool configuration, together with the {cinnamon-docs}/plugins/prometheus/prometheus.html#http-server[HTTP server exporter {tab-icon}, window="tab"]:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
.pom.xml
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::example$telemetry-sample/pom.xml[tag=telemetry-prometheus-dependencies]
----

Scala::
+
.build.sbt
[source,scala,indent=0]
----
include::example$telemetry-sample/build.sbt[tag=telemetry-prometheus-dependencies]
----

After you have made that alteration, enable the HTTP server exporter using the following configuration:

.src/main/resources/telemetry.conf
[source,hocon]
----
include::example$telemetry-sample/src/main/resources/telemetry.conf[tag=telemetry-config-prometheus]
----

Metrics from Prometheus will now be available at the configured server location. If you are using the defaults, the location is http://localhost:9001/metrics.

See the {cinnamon-docs}/plugins/prometheus/prometheus.html[Full Telemetry documentation  {tab-icon}, window="tab"] for  details and references regarding Prometheus configuration.
